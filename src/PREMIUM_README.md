If you're familiar with ZipList Recipe plugin, built by ZipList, you'll quickly note that Zip Recipe plugin is an extension of this plugin and it is 100% compatible with it. The Zip Recipes plugin is very easy to use, however, we also provide enhanced [step-by-step instructions](http://www.ziprecipes.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/plugin-instructions-4.0.0.9.pdf) for your recipe blog. 

Among the new features added by Zip Recipe plugin are:

**Works with WordPress 4.2:** Updated for full compatibility with WordPress 4.2.

**Schema Recipe Support:** Automatically integrate Schema.org's Recipe mark-up into your recipe posts to make them easier to find by people searching for recipes. 

**Recipe Image Support:** Easily add recipe image using Media Library to appear with your recipe.

**Copy/Paste Recipe Ingredients:** Simply cut a block of recipe ingredients and paste them into one field. No need to add each recipe ingredient one by one into separate recipe ingertient fields.

**Auto-Populate Recipe Name:** The recipe name is automatically replicated inside the plugin, taking the name from the recipe post name, which further enhances SEO.

**Add Links to Recipe Ingredients, Instructions or Other Recipes:** Attach affiliate links or links to related recipes from the Ingredients, Instructions or Summary fields with ease. No other recipe plugin enables you to do this.

**Bold and Italicized Styling for your Recipe:** Add bold or italicized styling to words or phrases within the Recipe Ingredients, Instructions, Summary and Notes sections. 

**Incorporate Recipe Images into Instructions:** Now you can easily add step-by-step images to your instructions (or ingredients) from within the recipe plugin.

**Recipe Notes Field:** Add notes to your recipes, such as optional ingredients, required kitchen tools and equipment and/or additional instructions (e.g., freezing, microwave, etc.)

**Enhanced Recipe Printing Capabilities:** Add a copyright statement or URL to appear at the bottom of your printed recipes. Also, display a permalink at the bottom of printed recipes so users can easily find individual recipes on your website.

**Multiple Paragraph Support in Summary Section of a Recipe:** Users can now add multiple paragraphs to the Summary field within the recipe plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit a recipe with the Zip Recipes plugin? =

To edit or create a recipe, click the spoon and fork icon on the visual editor toolbar. You no longer need to click on the image placeholder within the blog post to edit a recipe.

= Can I use the plugin to add multiple recipes to one post or page? =

There should only be one recipe per post or page. The plugin does allow for compound recipes which is one way to include multiple lists of ingredients in your post (e.g., for a salad and a salad dressing).Simply enter your instructions for the main recipe, then start the next line with an exclamation point to create a label, like "!For the Salad Dressing". Then, add the instructions for the secondary recipe. Starting with version 2.4, we no longer support multiple Zip Recipes recipes within a single post.

= When I use Zip Recipe plugin where are the recipes stored? =

Your recipes are always stored on your own website. With Zip Recipes plugin, your recipes are stored safely in a separate database table in your main WordPress database. The recipe table is named wp_amd_zlrecipe_recipes and you can take a look at it yourself using any WordPress database tools at your disposal.

= Why do you put a placeholder image into my Edit Post page, instead of my actual recipe? =

Because of the way WordPress' text editor works, if you decide to add or remove something from your recipe using the text editor, it can very easily mess up the markup of the code - so the Zip Recipe plugin prevents that from happening by not allowing you to edit the recipe in the text editor.

= How can I request a feature to be added in future versions of the Zip Recipes plugin? =

I'm glad you asked! You can email [hello@ziprecipes.net](mailto:hello@ziprecipes.net) with your requests.



== Screenshots ==

1. The Zip Recipes plugin icon appears as a fork and spoon on the visual editor toolbar.
2. It's easy to enter the basic information for your recipes: the title, the ingredients and the instructions for preparing the recipe.
3. There is no limit to the number of ingredients you can add.
4. And if you want to add even more information about your recipe, such as your rating of the recipe, or the serving size, all you have to do is click the "More Options" link, and you can!
5. You can fill out as many or as few additional options as you would like.
6. Once you click the "Add Recipe" button, a placeholder image will be inserted into your post where your recipe will go. If you need to edit your recipe, simply click on the spoon and fork icon in the visual editor toolbar.
7. Once you preview or publish the post, your recipe will be there with all your microformats (hrecipe)... without any extra work from you!
8. Voila! Your new recipe can easily be styled with CSS, to look however you would like.
